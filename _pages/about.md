I am a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Deeparnab Chakrabarty](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~deepc/). I am broadly interested in algorithms and deep learning. I am currently working on graph query algorithms. 

Previously I spent five years at Carnegie Mellon University.
