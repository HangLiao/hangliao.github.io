Here is a list of Youtubers whose videos I really enjoy. Ever since COVID started (or even before that), I spent a good amount of time watching Youtube videos. Initially I watched recorded game streaming but recently I mostly watch traveling/food videos. Watching any of them probably requires Chinese proficiency but you might be able to enjoy the ones with subtitles that allow auto-translation.

#### Youtuber list
<ul>

    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5IZoMHDRHV9j7MYMGNO_Ug">品城记</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%E6%9D%A8%E6%97%AD%E6%B8%B8%E8%AE%B0">杨旭游记</a></li>

This list is subject to change as I am changing (and evolving) and my like/dislike changes.
