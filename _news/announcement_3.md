Here is a list of Youtubers whose videos I really enjoy. Ever since COVID started (or even before that), I spent a good amount of time every day watching Youtube videos. Initially I watched recorded game streaming from Chinese streamers but now I mostly watch traveling/food videos. Probably watching any of them require Chinese proficiency but some might include subtitles that allow auto-translation.

This list is subject to change as I am changing (and evolving I hope) and my like/dislike changes.
