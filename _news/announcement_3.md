Here is a list of Youtubers whose videos I really enjoy. Ever since COVID started (or even before that), I spent a good amount of time every day watching Youtube videos. Initially I watched recorded game streaming from Chinese streamers but now I mostly watch traveling/food videos. Probably watching any of them require Chinese proficiency but some might include subtitles that allow auto-translation.

#### Youtuber list
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdLbTwziL6Tg97swkuThSg">20岁了还没去过星巴克</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5IZoMHDRHV9j7MYMGNO_Ug">品城记</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%E6%9D%A8%E6%97%AD%E6%B8%B8%E8%AE%B0">杨旭游记</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Shippiddge">Shippiddge</li>
</ul>

This list is subject to change as I am changing (and evolving I hope) and my like/dislike changes.
